# AntiCombatLog

AntiCombatLog is a plugin that helps you to prevent combat logging.

This readme is a work in progress.

This plugin still has bugs, so it would be appreciated if you would create an issue if you experience any!

Also feel free to submit pull requests!

## Languages
The plugin's messages are all fully configurable.
A spanish config file can be found [here](https://github.com/Badbird5907/AntiCombatLog/blob/master/src/main/resources/config-esp.yml), thanks to DLZ#0661 for translating it!

# Code quality
I'm sorry about this mess of spaghetti code. I wrote this plugin when I was learning java. Currently working on a rewrite.
